# FoxSploit
simple roblox exploit made in C# by me, Foxxive.
originally i was practicing just simple C# coding and then i got the wonderful idea to make it a roblox exploit, so here we are now

it uses the WeAreDevsAPI which, i know, sucks.
but it's all i had available to me and was the easiest thing to use, so i went ahead and used it.

this is the source code for the exploit, so you guys can see that there are no viruses, no suspicious code, nothing. just a lil roblox exploit

i am not responsible for what you do with this.
